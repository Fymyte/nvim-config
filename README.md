# My neo-vim config

## Plugins
I am using vim-plug to manage all my plugins
A list of plugins I am using can be found under `plugins/plugins.vim`

## Personal config
I have splitted my config into multiple files for easier debugging
and error tracking.
All my configs can be found under configs/*.vim
